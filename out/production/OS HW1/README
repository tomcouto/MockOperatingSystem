To run just use the Runnable.java file to run and the printout should be in console.
This requires an editor with a console.

********************
HW 1(Runnable.java)

How it works:

The runnable class runs a for loop creating a new Process object
with a random ID and increasing the process counter before adding it to a stack.
Then the thread is on sleep for 5 seconds before starting the loop again where the old
process gets printed and then deleted from the stack. After the process is deleted a new process
is made and put on the stack. This continues for 10 minutes.
********************
HW 2(PriorityRun.java)

How to run:

Run PriorityRun.java only

How it works:

The PriorityRun class creates 4 queues to store processes based on a randomly set priority from 1-4. 4 being the highest
and 1 being the lowest. Only the head of the priority 4 queue is ever 'run'. Every 2 seconds is 1 quantum and each process
is given a random number of quantums from 1-6. After 2 quantums the priority 4 queue is rotated (round robin). Then if
the priority 4 queue has less than 10 processes in it the priorities of every lower priority is increased by 1. This ensures
that all the processes will be run. After 10 quantums, 5 new processes are created and pushed into the queues.
